"""Systemic locks against INPUT-poisoning of the split-brain validation (generic).

The split-brain covenant stops the builder from authoring the JUDGMENT (the DoD /
rubric). It does NOT, by itself, stop the builder from poisoning the INPUTS the
validator reasons from — the "givens", the topology map, the standing lessons.
These four locks turn that remaining procedural trust into enforced invariants.

Attack vectors (from an adversarial review) and the lock that closes each:

  LOCK 1  Semantic smuggling -- the builder rigs the validator brief's "given" /
          scope-boundary section with a FALSE given ("X is a known stakeholder
          exception, out of scope") so the blind validator authors a weak DoD.
          LOCK: a scope-boundary / "given" that asserts something is out of scope
          or a ratified exception, with NO record pointer (RD-### / decision
          record), is an UNVERIFIED builder assertion -> ADVISORY flag (paired
          with the template directive telling the validator to ATTACK un-cited
          givens). Advisory, not hard: a legitimately-cited given is the norm, and
          over-blocking here would push givens out of the brief entirely.

  LOCK 2  Lie by omission -- the builder omits IAM from the brief's topology map,
          so the blind validator never authors a privilege-escalation check even
          though the backdoor is right there in the diff.
          LOCK: scan the raw DIFF (objective repo truth, not the curated brief) for
          an added IAM/trust/privilege change (AWS::IAM::*, a trust/assume-role
          policy, or a `Resource: "*"` / `Action: "*"` wildcard). If the diff adds
          one but the validator brief's DoD does NOT target IAM/privilege/trust ->
          HARD FAIL. Binds the validator to the diff, not the brief.

  LOCK 3  Advisory bypass -- the builder buries a subtle SCOPE REDUCTION in
          conversational noise, betting a tired human ignores the volume advisory.
          LOCK: the dangerous payload is the scope reduction itself, which is
          unambiguous -> compare a handoff against its PREVIOUS committed version;
          if a scope / boundary / deliverable / constraint bullet was REMOVED ->
          HARD FAIL. (Volume stays advisory in check_docs; shrinkage is hard.)

  LOCK 4  Poisoning the standing OS -- the builder promotes a shield-lowering
          "general lesson" into METHODOLOGY.md, rewriting the OS for every spawn.
          LOCK: any diff that touches METHODOLOGY.md is a PRIVILEGED change ->
          HARD FAIL unless the commit range carries an explicit ratification
          marker (RATIFIED-BY-STAKEHOLDER, or an RD-### pointer). Promotion becomes
          a stakeholder ratification act, not a silent builder commit.

Design notes:
  * GIT-SOURCED but ISOLATED. Locks 2/3/4 need a diff + commit messages; this
    module takes an explicit base..head ref range so it is deterministic and
    unit-testable, and FAIL-OPEN when git / the range / the artifacts are absent
    (so a partially-adopted repo or a non-git checkout is never spuriously blocked).
  * check_docs.py stays the pure-filesystem gate; it calls run_locks() only when a
    git repo + a resolvable range exist.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_locks.py --base origin/main --head HEAD
    python3 scripts/check_locks.py --self-test

Exit codes:
    0  PASS (no HARD violations; advisories may print)
    1  FAIL (one or more HARD lock violations)
    2  usage / environment error
