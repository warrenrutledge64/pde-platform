This is not a coding style guide. It is a **way of working** — how work is
planned, executed, validated, and carried from one working session to the next so
that progress is real, provable, and never built on unproven ground.

---

## 1. The core idea

Big builds fail in predictable ways: work drifts from the plan, "done" is claimed
on things that were never actually verified, and each new working session starts
cold and re-learns (or forgets) what the last one knew. This operating system
exists to prevent exactly those failures. It rests on a few principles:

1. **One story at a time, to completion.** Work is broken into small, ordered
   *stories*. A session takes exactly one story and finishes it. No half-done
   stories left drifting.
2. **Nothing is "done" on inference.** A story is only complete when its result is
   **validated live** and that result is **recorded**. A command exiting without
   error is not proof. "It should work" is never a status.
3. **Validation drives status; status gates advancement.** The recorded validation
   result is what flips a story to done — and you cannot start a story until the
   stories it depends on are done. (See §4, the Validation & Advancement Gate.)
4. **Build from a known-good point; revert, don't forward-patch.** Every validated
   milestone becomes a labeled, returnable restore point. When a slice goes bad,
   you return to the last good point rather than piling fixes onto a broken base.
5. **Warm handoffs.** Each session ends by writing the *next* session's briefing
   while the context is fresh — so the next session starts knowing everything the
   last one learned, including what went wrong.
6. **Two brains, clear roles.** A **planner** decides *what* and *why* and keeps
   the long memory; an **executor** does *how* — builds, tests, and hands back a
   result. They are bridged by a written prompt (see §2).

Everything below is the machinery that makes these principles automatic instead of
aspirational.

## 2. The two roles (split-brain)

| Role | Owns | Analogy |
|------|------|---------|
| **Planner** (strategic) | Architecture, risk, story sequencing, cross-session memory, course-correction. Decides *what* to build next and *why*. | The navigator |
| **Executor** (tactical) | Implements exactly one story: builds, tests, pushes, opens the change for review, reports results. Decides *how*. | The driver |

The two are deliberately separate so neither drifts into the other's job. The
planner does not write the code; the executor does not silently re-plan the
roadmap. They communicate through **one artifact per story: a written prompt**
(the executor's kickoff) generated from a **brief** (the human-readable story
spec). The brief is the source of truth; the prompt is generated from it.

> You can play the planner yourself, or use a second AI/collaborator for it. What
> matters is that the *planning* thinking and the *executing* thinking are kept
> distinct and handed off explicitly in writing.

---

## 3. The unit of work: a Story

A **story** is the smallest independently-valuable, independently-validatable slice
of work. Stories are grouped into **phases** (larger milestones). Each story has:

- an **ID** (e.g. `1.2`) and a **title**;
- a list of stories it **depends on**;
- concrete **do-it steps**;
- a **Definition of Done that is a pass/fail validation gate**, not a description;
- a **status** and a recorded **validation result**.

Stories are ordered by **dependency and reuse value** — do the things that unblock
or get reused by the most downstream work first. Genuine shared foundations are
pulled forward and built once, early.

---

## 4. The Validation & Advancement Gate (the heart of the system)

This is the rule that makes "done" mean something. It is **binding**: it drives
status changes and dictates whether work advances.

**Roles.** The **validator** (usually the human, on the live system) runs the
check and confirms the outcome. The **executor records** the result and only then
changes the status. **The executor never self-certifies a story as done.**

**Status legend**

`⬜ Not Started` · `🟡 In Progress` · `⛔ Blocked` · `✅ Done (validated)`

**Story state machine** — a story moves only on a recorded validation result:

| From | Event | To |
|------|-------|----|
| ⬜ | work begins | 🟡 |
| 🟡 | validation **passes** (recorded, confirmed) | ✅ |
| 🟡 | validation **fails / incomplete** | stays 🟡 (or ⛔ if externally blocked) |
| ✅ | (never auto-reverts; a regression opens a new remediation story) | — |

**Two hard rules that follow from it:**

1. **No result → no ✅.** Without a recorded, confirmed pass, a story stays 🟡.
   There is no "probably done."
2. **Fail → no advancement.** If a story fails or is only partially validated, you
   **stay on that story** until it passes. The next session's job becomes *fix and
   re-validate this story* — not the next one.

**Hard advancement gate.** A story **cannot begin** until **every** story it
depends on is ✅. If a dependency isn't ✅, the executor stops and surfaces it
rather than starting.

**Phase gate.** A phase closes **only** when its end-of-phase check passes and is
recorded. On phase-close — and not before — you capture a **restore point**
(§6), record it in the inventory, and mark the phase done.

**Recording a result.** Every story carries a one-line, dated **Validation
Result**: `pass — <what was checked>, <date>, confirmed by <who>` or
`FAIL — <what failed>, <date>`. That line is the auditable driver behind the
status marker. The marker without a recorded result is not a valid ✅.

---

## 4a. Independent validation — who *authors* the check

The gate above says *who confirms* a result (the validator, on the live system) and
*who records* it (the executor). This adds **who authors the check** — and the
answer is deliberately **not the party that built the code.**

**The failure mode it closes: "grading your own paper."** When the builder also
(a) writes the pass/fail rubric, (b) curates what evidence the check looks at, and
(c) interprets the results, a green validation proves only that the work is
*internally consistent with the builder's own understanding* — not that it is
correct. The builder can unknowingly test its own misreading of the spec and
confirm it.

**The split — three parties, distinct jobs:**

| Party | Owns | Must NOT |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Executor** (builder) | Builds the code; on a recorded pass, records the result + flips status. | Author the rubric it's judged by; curate what the validator sees; interpret the live results. |
| **Validator** (independent — e.g. a second AI / the planner brain) | Authors the live-validation steps **and its own Definition of Done**, from the requirement + the raw change — tasked to try to **break** the change, not confirm it. | Have written the code under test; inherit the builder's rubric. |
| **Human (stakeholder)** | Carries the **raw change** (pulled from the repo, not a package the builder curated) and states the requirement in their **own words**; **runs the steps on the real system and reads the raw output**; decides. | Rubber-stamp a "builder-built-it, validator-approved-it" handshake without reading the literal output. |

**Why the inputs must not come from the builder.** Independence lives with
*whoever frames what gets tested*. If the executor hands the validator a curated
package — which diff to look at, which invariants to list, which DoD to use — the
validator only confirms the picture the builder painted. So the two judgment
inputs — **the change** and **the requirement the DoD is derived from** — come from
the human/repo, never curated by the builder.

**A diff is never enough.** The validator authors its check from the **full
context**, not just changed lines — a change can be correct in isolation yet break
the unchanged code around it. Give the validator the full source of what it's
judging, pinned to the exact committed version.

**How to run it:** paste [`DOCS/VALIDATOR_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`](../DOCS/VALIDATOR_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md)
to an independent validator (a fresh chat / a second AI such as Gemini), fill it
from the requirement + the raw change **yourself**, and let it author the DoD and
steps blind. The depth scales with the story: a light doc-consistency check and a
security-boundary check use the *same* protocol, only the DoD and retained evidence
go deeper for the higher-stakes story.

> **Right-sizing.** If you're a solo developer without a second AI, you can still
> get most of the value by having the *planner* brain (not the executor) author the
> DoD, and by reading the raw live output yourself. The rule that always holds:
> **the party that built it does not get to frame how it's judged.**

## 5. The session ritual

Every working session — no exceptions — follows this shape:

**A. Open — Validation & Advancement Gate first (before any new work):**
1. **Close out the prior story.** Read the ledger. If the prior story is 🟡 pending
   validation, get the validator's result. On pass → record it + flip to ✅. On
   fail → keep it 🟡 and re-focus this session on fixing it.
2. **Check the advancement gate.** Confirm this story's dependencies are all ✅. If
   not, stop and surface the blocker.

**B. Middle — one story to completion:**
- Design → build → the validator runs the live check → record the result → flip
  status. Push work to a branch and open it for review; never push straight to the
  protected main line.

**C. Close — warm handoff (mandatory, do not skip):**
- Author the **next** story's brief and prompt while context is fresh, including a
  **Lessons Learned / Carry-Forward** section with what *actually* happened this
  session: bugs hit and their fixes, decisions that mattered, the corrected true
  state of the system, operator/UX lessons, and watch-items. Favor lessons from
  the live run over pre-run guesses. A handoff with an empty lessons section is
  incomplete.

---

## 6. Restore-point discipline

A **restore point** is a labeled, returnable known-good state, captured at each
phase gate (and any other point worth being able to return to). It has two halves
that are always captured together:

1. **Code** — an immutable tag on the exact validated commit (e.g. a
   `restore/phase-N-green` convention). Immutable, annotated, created only on a
   confirmed pass.
2. **State** — a manifest of whatever the code deploys/produces (infrastructure,
   config, versions), captured so the deployed reality is recorded, not inferred.

Because the two are paired, you never restore one without the other. When a slice
goes bad, you **return to the last restore point** rather than forward-patching a
broken base. The rule that prevents drift: *if it's deployed, it's in the
inventory; if it's in the inventory, it maps to a restore point.*

---

## 7. Universal disciplines (apply to everything)

- **Verify the real artifact, not the intention.** After a change, confirm the
  *actually-deployed/produced* thing contains the change — the local file passing
  is not proof.
- **State your context on every operational command.** If commands run against
  specific environments/accounts, prefix every command block with a banner naming
  where it runs. Confirm the target before destructive actions.
- **Production-quality by default.** No mock data or placeholder services standing
  in for real ones unless explicitly agreed; real connections, error handling,
  and tests from the start.
- **Interactive prompts read from the terminal, not piped input** — or piped data
  silently auto-answers them. Fail safe (default to "no") when there is no
  terminal.
- **Give the operator the full copy-paste sequence** — every step, in order, with
  real values substituted — not bare command names that assume context.

---

## 8. The document set

These ship in the starter template (blank, with double-brace placeholder tokens)
and are filled in per project. Together they *are* the persistent memory of the
project — the system has no memory outside these files.

| Document | Role |
|----------|------|
| `PROJECT_PLAN.md` | The *what/why*: scope, phases, decisions, acceptance criteria. |
| `RUNBOOK.md` | The *do-it-and-track-it* ledger: every story with status, dependencies, do-it steps, validation result. **Contains the binding Validation & Advancement Gate.** This is the source of truth for status. |
| `BOM.md` (inventory / bill of materials) | The authoritative list of everything the project produces/deploys, each entry tied to a restore point. Defense against drift. |
| `RESTORE.md` | The restore-point procedure: tagging convention, state capture, and coordinated revert. |
| `SESSION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` | Human-facing story spec (for all stakeholders); doubles as change record + audit artifact. |
| `SESSION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` | Executor-facing kickoff prompt, generated from the brief; primes a fresh session with zero cold-start. |
| `session-briefs/` | The filled-in briefs + prompts, one per story, as the project runs. |

## 9. How to start a new project with this kit

1. **Create a new repo from the starter template** ("Use this template" on GitHub),
   then replace every project-name placeholder token with your project's name.
2. **Fill `PROJECT_PLAN.md`** — scope, phases, the ordered story list, acceptance
   criteria. Keep the Universal Acceptance Criteria that apply to every story.
3. **Seed `RUNBOOK.md`** from the plan — one row per story, dependencies set, all
   ⬜. Keep the Validation & Advancement Gate section verbatim; it is the engine.
4. **Adjust `RESTORE.md` and `BOM.md`** to your project's technology (what a
   "state manifest" means for you).
5. **Protect your main line** so it is change-by-review only (no direct pushes,
   no force-push). This is what makes the restore-point history trustworthy.
6. **Run story 1** using the session ritual (§5): fill its brief + prompt from the
   templates, execute to a validated pass, then write the next story's handoff.

That's the whole system. It is intentionally lightweight — a handful of documents
and one binding rule — because the discipline, not the tooling, is what makes
progress real.
